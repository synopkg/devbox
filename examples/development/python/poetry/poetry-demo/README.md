# Python with Poetry Example

Poetry automatically configures a virtual environment for installing your Python packages. This environment can be activated by running `poetry shell` from within your poetry project.

For more information, see the [Poetry Docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/)

## How to Run

In this directory, run:

`synopkg.github.io/devboxell`

This will automatically activate your poetry shell via the `init_hook`.

To exit the poetry shell, use `exit`. To exit your synopkg.github.io/devboxell, use `exit` again.

## Configuration

Since Poetry automatically configures a virtual environment for you, no additional Devbox configuration is needed. You can mange your packages and projects.
